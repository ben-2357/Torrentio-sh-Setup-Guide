## [Torrentio-sh](https://github.com/Gabisonfire/torrentio-scraper-sh) prerequisites:

 1. Linux on a machine (Preferably Ubuntu or Debian based and a server based distribution with ssh enabled). [Here's a great video tutorial by TechHut on how to do this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2m52F0S2w8) 
 
 2. A static local IP on your Linux machine. [Here's a great video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fayx4jWqyWk)
 
 3. A [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org/) account with ports 80 TCP and 443 TCP forwarded on your router. [Here's a great video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9jH8QPsVOw). ****Note: This is only required for remote access outside of your home wifi.****
 
 4. Patience lol

## Install Docker (simply copy and paste the commands)

Add the Docker apt repository

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```
Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin docker-compose
```
Now add your user to the docker group or see the [post-installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/) step on Docker's website
```bash
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
Reboot to finalize the Docker install.
```bash
sudo reboot
```

## Install Torrentio-sh

Clone the Torrentio-sh repository
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y git
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/Gabisonfire/torrentio-scraper-sh
cd torrentio-scraper-sh
docker compose up -d
```
You can view your Torrentio-sh instance in a browser at ```http://yourip:7000```

You can view your machine's IP with ```ifconfig```  or ```ip a```  

## Updating Torrentio-sh (Releasing script for this soon)

You can update Torrentio-sh install by running these commands

```bash
cd ~/torrentio-scraper-sh
docker-compose down
git pull
docker-compose up -d
```

## Make Torrentio-sh open to the internet. (Remote access)

### Setup DuckDNS

 1. Make a new subdomain on DuckDNS.org.
 2. Click ```install``` in the upper left corner.
 3. Select your newly created domain from step 1 in the drop down box.
 4. Proceed to copy all commands in order just like you have in this tutorial.

### Forward ports 80 and 443 to your Linux machine's IP address. 
[Here's a great video tutorial.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B9jH8QPsVOw)

### Next setup the reverse proxy. 
This is what sends Torrentio-sh uses to talk to other devices across the internet. We will use Caddy as a reverse proxy.

Start by downloading the caddy docker-compose.yaml file and starting the stack
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/ben-2357/Torrentio-sh-Setup-Guide
mv ~/Torrentio-sh-Setup-Guide/Caddy ~/Caddy
sudo rm -r Torrentio-sh-Setup-Guide
```
Replace ```subdomain.duckdns.org``` ,with your previously chosen DuckDNS subdomain, in the Caddyfile.
```bash
nano ~/Caddy/Caddyfile
```
Now hit ```Ctrl + x``` then ```y``` then ```Enter```

Finally start Caddy and visit your Torrentio-sh instance at ```yoursubdomain.duckdns.org```

Great job for making it through the whole guide.
